Finish:
all input file for placer, wait for check...


ToDo:
we can save instacne index in Nets class to save time in makeNetsFile
****solve the error on placer**** only case2 can run

Problem:
No min cut?(in case1 there are 5 cross net)

2023/6/13
Finish:
all the flow, case2 can pass

ToDo:
placement on case1

optimize:
reduce cut size (do a min cut partition then legalize?)
greedy placement (use greedy method to place second die then legalize?)
change file I/O to fprintf
Terminal placement(now is just place to pass verifier)

# ntuplacer usage optimize:

## (a) 
Open Global placement so that avoid the long distance swap in detail placement to save some execution time.

## (b) 
No detail placement in NTUPlace, since the optimize is only for top die & bottom die, 
there is no connection between top die and bottom die placement, create our own heuristic (SA? algorithm) to perform the 3D detail placement
